I usually spend all my time studying mathematics during the holidays. When I was 9, my mother gave me a book about Carl Friedrich Gauss and his formula to the sum of the natural numbers. Out of curiosity, I opened the book and had a peek. To my surprise, my holiday studies equipped me with the knowledge to understand how his formula works.

                    'In secondary school, I joined an olympiad team. At that time, I made a few friends who are also passionate about mathematics. We would often stay after school discussing olympiad questions or learning new concepts in mathematics. Subsequently, I got a high distinction in a local olympiad competition. I gained huge confidence from this achievement, for this reason, I am motivated to continue my studies and research in mathematics.',
                    '“Fermat’s Enigma” by Simon Singh explains the history of mathematics through the topic of Fermat’s Last Theorem, a conjecture stating that xn+yn=zn do not exist for n greater or equal to 3. This book solidified my understanding in mathematics as it explains how different areas of mathematics are discovered and created. I was also shocked when I read about how Pythagoras threw his disciple into the water because he introduced the existence of irrational numbers, which Pythagoras did not wish to believe existed.',
                    'I love joining mathematics competitions, as it stimulates my brain into thinking of different methods to solve a question. I have received a Gold Award in the UKMT Competition, whilst ranking the first amongst my year. I also won a bronze medal in the IMO selection test in Malaysia. The preparation for these competitions is hard to plan, as the questions vary from algebraic expressions to using different methods of proof to show that a given statement is true. My strategy is to research different areas in mathematics to further deepen my understanding for each of the topics.',
                    'As a senior in school, I utilize the knowledge I’ve gained from joining olympiad competitions to prepare my juniors for different competitions. To this end, I create targeted puzzles for them to solve. I developed my abilities to communicate and to present as I teach the juniors and discover the best ways to explain difficult concepts. I am passionate about developing games in my free time, applying mathematics that I learn in school to help develop them, or finding different mathematical equations that can be used to achieve different effects. For example, adding a vibrating path to a travelling particle uses different math equations - programming a sine wave in terms of time, scaling the vibration with the magnitude of the speed, and also calculating the velocity.',
                    'I am really interested, and motivated to study mathematics in the most prestigious universities in the UK as an undergraduate and to achieve a Doctoral degree. I aspire to become a university professor educating mathematics content, and help those students that are interested in mathematics.']

        'description': 'Joseph Tan is not in a university yet. Please do note that he hates Python and somehow he is using django.',
        'content': ['The existence and evolution of law are intrinsically tied to the concept of equality. Yet, its ability to enshrine equality, and uphold notions of justice, are often frustrated across our increasingly complex and diverse societies. As a citizen of multicultural Malaysia, it is easy to observe that intra-ethnic disparities continue to be a sensitive and divisive issue. Arguably, it is a nation where it is seen that not everyone has the same access to principles of equality and justice.',
                    'My interest in how the law interprets ‘equality’ stemmed from Malaysia’s controversial matriculation programme intake quota as a realisation of Article 153 of the Federal Constitution. The preferential treatment for a particular racial-religious group at the expense of others has proved a taboo in a nation with long-held racial tensions. Furthermore, this Article has found protection under the Sedition Act making explicit criticism of it illegal. Thus, the way in which the law has been used to protect the privilege of some over others calls into question the malleability and adaptability of law in the face of race, religion and political variables. While efforts have been made to thwart present dissidence towards this issue, all have failed to present a legal challenge that can be heard.',
                    'Equipped with a contextual understanding of historical events, I enjoy visualising the intersectionality of law by drawing upon examples of different historical accounts. However, we no longer live in such times, and this raises questions about when and how should the law be reviewed and evolved to ensure that it protects the freedoms and opportunities of all people. For example, the overarching effects of Asian conservatism in law and international politics is one that I have studied extensively. Much like the application of democracy, I have learned that the progression of law can only be ratified under the pretence of international agreement and collaboration. In addition, the essential need for clear and accessible use of language, and how that is interpreted and applied in law also interests me greatly; especially in terms of the proper use, accessibility and coherence of law towards all of society’s individuals. Through my A-Level English Literature studies, I was struck by Atwood’s portrayal of the law’s manipulation by those with power in The Handmaid’s Tale. ',
                    'I have a real passion for Literature, Geography, Politics and History. Thus, the study of law seems the next logical step in my educational journey. During my time at King Henry VIII College, I received the school English and Geography Awards as recognition for my outstanding performances and attainment in these subject areas. I also ensure that I follow through with meaningful actions to give expression to the goals I feel strongly about. For example, as an active youth advocate, I volunteer for a women’s community organisation in its efforts to empower young women through workshops and talks. I am currently the Secretary-General of my school’s Model United Nations club and have led our team of students through many memorable conferences. My work with a local theatre collective has also encouraged the growth of my debating and public speaking skills.',
                    'As a student who has always enjoyed academic success, and has high ambitions, the UK has always been the Elysium of my educational hopes. Most of all, I hope to return home having excelled in my legal studies abroad to help contribute to making Malaysia a more equal and just society. After all, Aristotle is credited with having once said “The only stable state is the one in which all men are equal before the law.” I believe that the only way that will ever come about is if young people like myself dedicate themselves to the legal profession.'
